This project implements a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet34) for age estimation from facial images, leveraging ordinal regression (CORAL) and categorical classification (cross-entropy) approaches. The model is trained on labeled facial datasets, with predictions generated by thresholding output probabilities (ordinal) or argmax selection (classification). Input preprocessing includes spatial resizing (128×128 → 120×120 center crop) and tensor normalization. The framework supports CUDA-accelerated inference with PyTorch, featuring dynamic device allocation (CPU/GPU) and dataset-specific label offset correction (ADD_CLASS). The CLI interface allows configurable execution with hyperparameters for loss functions (CORAL/CE), parallel workers, and model checkpoint loading.
